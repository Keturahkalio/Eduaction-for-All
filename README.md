# Education-for-All
  PROJECT BACKGROUND

  As a Data Analyst working for the charity, Education for All; the Head of Fundraising has asked me to present the data on donor insights and donation rates. Within     the Fundraising team, my objectives are to; Increase the number of donors in your database, increase the donation frequency of your donors and increase the value of   donations in your database.
  
  I have gathered insights from the Datasets provided which are;
  
   • Donation Data
   
   • Donor Data
   
  BUSINESS PROBLEM
  
  To use insights generated from the data provided to come up with strategies to increase value and frequency of donations for the following year.
  
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROCESS

1. Why do we need to come up with strategies to increase value and frequency of donations for the following year?

Because the previous strategies may not have yielded as much as we want


2. Why did the previous strategies not yield as much donations?

Because they were targeted at just one set of people or they were not carried out properly


3. Why were they not carried out properly?

Maybe the Fundraising team were not briefed properly on how to carry out the strategies effectively.


4. Why was the team not briefed properly?

It may have been an oversight of the head of fundraising



5. Why?

Maybe the head of fundraising thought that the team may have understood the strategies and how to go about implementing them.
